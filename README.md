This was a simple api I built using python and flask. I used it for learning with my data requested from indeed. There is sample data in the json.

Setup is simple.

Install Python
Setup venv
source venv
run job_api.py

From there you can send a curl request to 

http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/jobs
http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/jobs/titles]
http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/jobs/companies
http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/jobs/locations
